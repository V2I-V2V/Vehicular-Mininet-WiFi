# Analyze scripts

## Usage

### `analyze.py`
Assume the `Vehicular-Mininet-WiFi` is put at home directory.
```
python3 ~/Vehicular-Mininet-WiFi/analysis-scripts/analyze.py -d <data_dir> -f <frame_considered_in_analysis> -k <key_in_data_folder>
```

Explaining options:

* `-d <data_dir>`: `<data_dir>` is the directory to store experiment data, should contain multiple directories begin with `data-<timesamp>`.
* `-k <key_in_data_folder>`: `<key_in_data_folder>` specifies which part of data to analyze. For example, `-k data-0719`  means select all experiments in `<data_dir>` that was done on 7.19 (folder name begins with `data-0719`)
* `-f <frame_considered_in_analysis>`: frames taken into account for analysis. For example `-f 300` specifies that for exery node in every experiment, consider the first 300 frames.

#### Results generated by `analyze.py`
The results generated by `analyze.py` are:
* `combined.png`: distribution of each experiment
* `schedule_comapre.png`: aggregated results for each scheduling algorithm and their latency distribution
* `<scheduler>.png`: all exerpiment latency distribution with scheduling algorithm `<scheduler>`
* `[location, network, helpee-conf].png`: compare latency distribution of different scheduler on the same setup (loc, network, helpee configs)
* `[location, network, helpee-conf]-cdf.png`: CDF version compare different scheduler fixing other setup (loc, network, helpee configs)
* `[location, network, scheduler, helpee-conf]-per-node.png`: for experiments repeated on exact same setup, the per node mean latency (over all frames considered) and variance of the mean latency
* `[location, network, scheduler, helpee-conf]-frame-node.png`: for experiments repeated on exact same setup, the per frame mean latency and variance of each frame latency on each node
